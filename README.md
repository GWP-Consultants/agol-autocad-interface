# agol-autocad-interface
---
Working on a tool for implementing Esri based layers (field collector apps) into cad directly.  
This tool intends to work as a plugin to AutoCAD (full required for this, not LT) to connect to the arcgis online server without having to double handle data.  
Autocad plugins use C# and will need to be learnt to a higher level to work on this tool.
